- 'https://github.com/gopinav/React-19-Tutorials/tree/main/react-essentials' lecturer github repo about react.
- writing convention cases: camel-case-> semonHany, pascal-case-> SemonHany, snake-case-> semon_hany, kebab-case-> semon-hany

                                 introduction
- react is a component-based javaScript library can be used as a front-end framework. 
- qn open-source library created and managed by Facebook company. gets +220K stars on github.
- react is declarative(تصريحى) not impertive(أمرى)
  .for example when you go to an artist to draw a landscape or other when you tel him it's up to you then it's declarative 
  ,but when you tell him the details you want him to do then it's impretive.  
- update node.js to LTS(latest version): 
  *control panel-> programs-> uninstall-> Node.js for uninstallation.
  *install LTS from https://nodejs.org/en/download/   
  *add Node.js(folder containing Node_modules and other installed files) path to environment variables. 
   but usually added automatically by installer.
  *run node -v (it will print v24.12.0).

                                create react app     
- used command: 'npx create-react-app app-name'. 
  the app name must be in lower case with no capital letter. 
  npx is a npm(node package manager) package runner.
- another way to create react app without using 'npx' 
  is by installing the package globally 'npm install create-react-app -g' 
  then locally at each time we want to create new app 'create-react-app app-name'
- navigate inside the created project 'cd app-name' and run 'npm start' to run the local host server on port 3000 initially.
- edit in src/app.js which contains a function returns the home page html structure.    

- the latest creation command-> 'npm create vite@latest'. 
  the advantage of vite is that it applies the changes instantly without the need to refresh the full page.
- with vite creation some choices will be appear to select from including ['Project name', 'Select a variant'-> 'JavaScript + React Compiler',
  'Use rolldown-vite (Experimental)'-> 'No', 'install with npm and start now' create localhost server link]
- 'npm run dev' inside the project path to start the server.

                               folder structure
- package.json file contain the installed dependencies and scripts to deal with the project(start, buid oe test)
- package-lock.json file contain the instaled dependencies information including the version.
  necessary to reinstall them ('npm install') while colning repo with ignored node_modules folder which in turn contains the installed packages. 
- .gitignore file contain the sensitive or large folders that shouldn't push into github repo.
- public folder contain HTML files and generally accessed logos and images.
- public/index.html contain the page basic structure including div with id 'root' 
  that rendered with ReactDOM.createRoot later in src/index.js after build the basic html content inculded in it in src/app.js(app component).  
- to update the installed react run 'npm install react@latest react-dom@latest @types/react@latest @types/react-dom@latest' 
  which represent the latest stable release of the installed dependencies and some devdependencies.      
- the project created by vite is the same except that it has two extra files for configuration 
  and the src/index.js in the app created by create-react-app called src/main.jsx in vite.

                                   components
- react page contains 5 components(header, footer, main section, side nav and the app component containing all of them).
- there are two types of react components -> 
  *stateless functional components: simple functions return HTML structure, also called dumb or presentational components, used as much as possible and are mainly used in UI building.
  *stateful class component: a class extends another component class and have a method render that return HTML structure in its execution body, are more feature rich have their own data and state
   , provide lifecycle hooks (provide access to properties and states without using class this feature newly appeared in react V16.7.0 alpha), use complex UI logic, also called smart or container components.
- in creating components and export them from their js file then import in app.js and use them as a custom HTML tag (openening + closing tags or self-closing tag) in the return or render of the App.
- the convention of naming components (js or jsx) files is with kebab or pascal case (declared in line 2);
- with default export we can import the exported structure with another name, while with named export we must use the exact name in import.
- we import the named export inside {} while the default exported outside the curly brackets like in-> import React, {Component} from 'react'.
- without using jsx(javaScript extensible markup language(jsXML)) we return the HTML structure using React.createElement() method that takes the tag name as the first argument
  , object of tag's attributes and their values as a second parameter and the tag content in the third one.
- there are some differences between normal html and jsx like the simple tag attribute (class) called className as a DOM property, for in label tag called 'htmlFor' and tabindex in the input tag called 'tabIndex'.
- in jsx must return a single root(parent) element not multiple html elements. 
  each tag must be properly closed even the self closing tags '<br/>', unlike the normal html.
- comment in jsx done with the syntax {/*content*/}. 
- we deals with the properties come from the parent component using 'props' parameter passed to the child functional component or using this pointer in class comp 'this.props'.
  It's is an object containing the attributes declared inside the component custom tag (user-defined read-only attributes) and a default entry named 'children' if it has content.
- the component declared properties in parent (app) component if their values aren't string should be put inside {} ({true}, {47.8}, {[87,35,08]}).
- while destructing the props in the function or constructor passed argument, we can set default values used for missing or undefined properties but won't work with 0 or null values.
- string interpolation in angular done using {{}} in HTML template, while in react using {} in js DOM (jsx) to interpolate the value of any decalred variable in this component 
  [bool, string, integer, double or event a function-name(function reference)] or even an explicit value of type other than string.
- the constructor contain a special function called super() used to tell that this class is the base class.
- states are muttable variables declared inside the component.
- using the built-in method this.setState({}) in class comp will dynamically change the variables (also in the DOM where they were injected), unlike when change the state directly ehich will br static then.
- setState() method is non-blocking (syncronous) so it has a call-back function as a second parameter to access the updated state values asyncronously
  , also when we try to update the state value multiple times sequentially it will affect for only once while using this.state so we can have access to prevState property in the first parameter as a call-back function.
- install extension 'ES7 React, Redux,...' then to create the class component standard structure use 'rce + tab', 'rfce + tab' for functional component file structure, 'rconst' for building a constructor and 'rpce' for pure class component.
- class member functions declared without keyword 'function'. also member properties declared without let, const or var keyword.
- we can create function nested in another that happens in functional componenet while its member functions deflared inside it.
- in event handling we assign a reference to the event Handler function (inside {}) to the jsx event property like 'onClick' to be called automatically when the event occured.
- we need to bind the 'this' object to the event handler reference in class component to give it the accessibility to class' 'this' object properties.
- eventHandler binding approaches: 1- event-property={function-name.bind(this)}.   2- in class constructor-> this.function-name=function-name.bind(this).
  3- event-property={()=>function-name()}   4- declare handler property as an arrow function.
- when binding an array variable in JSX it dealt as an <ul></ul> element containing each element in the array as a <li></li> html element. 
  Each li element has a 'key' property with unique value.
- applying CSS styles on react component done using external css file by importing it in the top component file 
  ,or inline CSS which is an object with properties in camel-case instead of kebab(in external sheet) and string values
  or using CSS modules which must import with custom name refer to the whole file content and access its class selectors using -> module-name.class-name or -> module-name[class-name] in case of dynamic variable.
- css module is an external css file sheet but has locally scoped affect.
- using multiple className value -> className={`${primaryClass} ${headingClass}`}
- since reusable components have different behaviors, their event handlers must declared by each parent component call this resuable child component.
- class component lifycycle methods categoried into-> 
  *mounting: constructor(props), render(), getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state), componentDidMount()
  *updating: getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state), render(), shouldComponentUpdate(nextprops, nextstate), getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevprops, prevstate), componentDidUpdate(prevprops, prevstate, snapshot)
  *unmounting: componentWillUnmount()         *errorHandling: getDerivedStateFromError(error), componentDidCatch(error, info)
- mount phase methods logged twice because of the strict mode used in index.js in react V18 app.
- mounting order: constructor() ->getDerivedStateFromProps() ->render() ->(the same previous order for child component)  ->componentDidMount() (child-> parent).
- updating order: getDerivedStateFromProps() ->shouldComponentUpdate() ->render() -> getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() ->cpmponentDidUpdate().
- use <React.Fragment> </React.Fragment> to prevent using nested div tags in react components. It does the same as using empty openning tag +empty closing tag '<></>'. 
  That arises from the idea that the child react component should return a single enclosed parent tag.
- pure class component create by extending another pure component the difference distinguishes it from the regular component is in the updating phase when the regular doesn't check the method shouldComponentUpdate() instead it always return true
  , while pure component apply shallow comparison between the (current-props, current-state) snd (nextprops, nextstate) on the equality case and if it true returns false and doesn't call render() the vice versa.
- shallow comparison: *for primitive types-> if two variables have the same value and are of the same type returns true else false.
  *for complex types-> if two variables refer to the same exact objects(reference or shallow copy) returns true else false.
- memo functional component is a higher-order component(HOC) acts as the pure class component preventing unnecessary rerendering by applying props shallow comparison.
